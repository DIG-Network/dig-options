//! Report the signatures a set of coin spends requires — WITHOUT signing.
//!
//! dig-options never holds a key and never signs. After a builder produces its unsigned
//! `CoinSpend`s, the caller uses [`required_signatures`] to learn exactly which BLS messages
//! it must sign (each carrying the public key, the raw message, and the appended
//! coin/domain data), signs them with its own key material, and aggregates the result into
//! the `SpendBundle`. This keeps the signing decision — and the secret key — entirely on the
//! caller's side of the identity boundary (#908).
